Nobel Media Player
==================

A web-based client and a WebSocket server using [Mopidy](https://github.com/mopidy/mopidy).

This was built for my dorm's commonhouse bar where we have a touch-screen monitor. The server runs on the box that
is hooked up to our sound system.



### What you need to use this:

* A server box with [Mopidy](https://github.com/mopidy/mopidy) [Node JS](http://nodejs.org/) installed
* A client with a web browser on the same network as the server
